# Study MongoDB - Demo Sandbox

This is a demonstration and sandbox repository for learning MongoDB concepts using Node.js and Docker. It covers CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, relationships, and indexing.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+ recommended)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   Copy the example file to `.env` and configure it:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Start the MongoDB container:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Directory Structure

- `01_crud/`: Basic CRUD operations (Insert, Find, Update, Delete).
- `02_queries/`: Advanced query operators (Comparison, Logical, and Array-based queries).
- `03_aggregation/`: Aggregation framework pipelines (Grouping and multi-stage processes).
- `04_relations/`: Relationships modeling (Embedded documents, Reference/Lookup), and Indexing.
- `db.js`: Shared database connection helper.
- `docs/`: Reference notes and key architectural takeaways.

## Running the Examples

Run any script with Node.js. For example:

```bash
node 01_crud/1_insert.js
node 04_relations/2_lookup.js
```
